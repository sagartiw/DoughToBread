Instructions to start:
Before running anything, make sure to run "npm install" on both client and server

1. Open two terminals, and cd into client and server
2. On server, type "npm start"
3. The server will be running on localhost:5000 (there'll be some errors since I haven't connected to our mongodb properly yet)
4. On client, type "npm start"
5. A blank page should appear on localhost:3000
